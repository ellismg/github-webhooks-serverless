# Serverless Github Webhooks with AWS

This is a small library to make it easy to use [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com) to
author serverless GitHub Webhooks with AWS.

The is a follow up to my [Managing GitHiub Webhooks with Pulumi](http://blog.pulumi.com/managing-github-webhooks-with-pulumi) blog post.

The package is published on NPM, as `@ellismg/pulumi-github-webhooks`.
